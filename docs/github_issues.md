```

### Frontend Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests (Jest/Vitest + Testing Library)
```jsx
// Component Testing Areas
1. PlayerCard Component
   - Renders with correct data
   - Handles loading states
   - Click handlers work correctly
   - Responsive behavior

2. SpiderChart Component
   - Chart renders with data
   - Handles data updates
   - Interactive features work
   - Accessibility compliance

3. Forms
   - Input validation
   - Form submission
   - Error handling
   - Real-time updates
```

#### Integration Tests
```jsx
// User Workflow Testing
1. Player Management Flow
   - View player list
   - Add new player
   - Edit existing player
   - Delete player

2. Search and Filter Flow
   - Text search functionality
   - Filter combinations
   - Sort operations
   - URL state management

3. Navigation Flow
   - Route navigation
   - Back button behavior
   - 404 handling
```

#### Example Test Implementation
```jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { PlayerCard } from '../components/PlayerCard';

describe('PlayerCard', () => {
  const mockPlayer = {
    id: '1',
    name: 'LeBron James',
    team: 'Lakers',
    position: 'SF',
    overall_score: 95
  };

  test('renders player information correctly', () => {
    render(<PlayerCard player={mockPlayer} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('LeBron James')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Lakers')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('SF')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('95')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test('handles click events', async () => {
    const mockOnClick = jest.fn();
    render(<PlayerCard player={mockPlayer} onClick={mockOnClick} />);
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(mockOnClick).toHaveBeenCalledWith('1');
    });
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Testing (Playwright/Cypress)

#### Critical User Journeys
```javascript
// E2E Test Scenarios
1. Complete Player Management
   - Navigate to add player page
   - Fill out form with valid data
   - Submit and verify player appears in list
   - Edit player information
   - Delete player with confirmation

2. Search and Discovery
   - Search for specific player
   - Apply multiple filters
   - Sort results
   - Navigate to player detail page

3. Responsive Behavior
   - Test on mobile viewport
   - Test tablet layout
   - Test desktop functionality
```

### Performance Testing

#### Backend Performance Tests
```python
# Load Testing with pytest-benchmark
def test_player_list_performance(benchmark):
    # Test API response time with 1000 players
    result = benchmark(get_all_players)
    assert result['response_time'] < 200  # ms

def test_overall_score_calculation_performance(benchmark):
    # Test scoring algorithm efficiency
    player_data = generate_test_player()
    result = benchmark(calculate_overall_score, player_data)
    assert result['execution_time'] < 50  # ms
```

#### Frontend Performance Tests
```javascript
// Performance testing with Lighthouse CI
describe('Performance Tests', () => {
  test('Player list page loads within performance budget', async () => {
    const metrics = await getPageMetrics('/players');
    expect(metrics.firstContentfulPaint).toBeLessThan(1500);
    expect(metrics.largestContentfulPaint).toBeLessThan(2500);
    expect(metrics.cumulativeLayoutShift).toBeLessThan(0.1);
  });
});
```
